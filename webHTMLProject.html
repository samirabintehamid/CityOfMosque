    <blockquote style= "font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;"> mosque  from Arabic: مَسْجِد‎, romanized: masjid, literally "place of ritual prostration"), 
    also called masjid, is a place of worship for Muslims.</blockquote> 
      <p style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Trirong, serif;font-style: normal;">Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque, 
     whether or not it takes place in a special building. Informal and open-air places of worship 
     are called musalla, while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as jumaʿ.Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche
      (mihrab) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca (qiblah),ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued.
       The pulpit (minbar), from which the Friday (jumu'ah) sermon (khutba) is delivered, was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque, 
       but has since become common in smaller mosques. Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women.
        This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period and denomination.</p>


<p style="font-size: 19px; font-family: serif; font-style: normal;">Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer, Ramadan vigils, funeral services, Sufi ceremonies, marriage and business 
agreements, alms collection and distribution, as well as homeless shelters.Historically,
 mosques were also important centers of elementary education and advanced training in religious sciences. 
 In modern times, they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate, but higher learning 
 now generally takes place in specialised institutions.Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca (centre of the hajj),
  the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (burial place of Muhammad) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (believed to be the site of Muhammad's ascent to heaven).
  In the past, many mosques in the Muslim world were built over burial places of Sufi saints and other venerated figures, 
  which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations.</p>

With the spread of Islam, mosques multiplied across the Islamic world. Sometimes churches and temples were converted into mosques,
 which influenced Islamic architectural styles. While most pre-modern mosques were funded by charitable endowments, modern states 
 in the Muslim world have attempted to bring mosques under government control. Increasing government regulation of large mosques has been 
 countered by a rise of privately funded mosques of various affiliations and ideologies, many of which serve as bases for different Islamic 
 revivalist currents and social activism. Mosques have played a number of political roles. The rates of mosque attendance vary widely depending on the region.

    <tr><td style="padding: 2px; font-weight: normal;text-align: justify;">According to scholars, Islam started during the lifetime of Muhammad 
        in the 7th century CE,
         and so did architectural components such as the mosque. 
         In this case, either the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean 
         city of Massawa,or the Quba Mosque in the Hejazi city of Medina 
         (the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from
          Mecca in 622 CE), would be the first mosque that was built in the 
          history of Islam.Other scholars, reference Islamic tradition
          and passages of the Quran,that claim Islam as a religion preceded
           Muhammad, and includes previous prophets such as Abraham.
            Abraham in Islam is credited by Muslims with having built 
            the Ka'bah ('Cube') in Mecca, and consequently its sanctuary,
             Al-Masjid Al-Haram (The Sacred Mosque), which is seen by Muslims
              as the first mosque that existed.
               A Hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the sanctuary of
               the Kaaba was the first mosque on Earth, with the second 
               mosque being Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem,
                which is also associated with Abraham.<br></td>

                 or make the annual pilgrimage known as Hajj to the city.

<!-- about mosques -->
<section style="font-size: 19px; font-family: serif; font-style: normal;">
<h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: steelblue;">The Origin of the Mosque</h3>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad's original house in Medina (in present-day Saudi Arabia) is thought to be the first mosque and probably served as a model for early mosque architecture. It was a mud-brick structure with living quarters on one side of an enclosed rectangular courtyard. Since Muhammad's followers would gather at his home for prayer, the side of the courtyard facing the qibla, or the direction of prayer, included a porch covered by palm branches, which offered shelter from the hot desert sun.
     Most early mosques, as well as the majority of later mosques in Arab lands</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: rgb(31, 103, 161);">Essential Architectural Elements of a Mosque</h3> 
<h4 style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; color: rgb(105, 110, 114);">The essential architectural elements include: </h4>
<ul>
   

       <li> The qibla is the direction Muslims face when praying toward the Ka'ba in Mecca. The qibla wall is the wall in a mosque that faces Mecca.</li>
<li>        The mihrab is a niche in the qibla wall indicating the direction of Mecca; because of its importance, it is usually the most ornate part of a mosque, highly decorated and often embellished with inscriptions from the Qur'an .</li>
</li>
<li>        The minbar is a pulpit in the form of a staircase on which the prayer leader (imam) stands when delivering a sermon after Friday prayer. The pulpit is usually situated to the right of the mihrab and is often made of elaborately carved wood or stone 
</li>       <li> A minaret is a tall tower attached or adjacent to a mosque. It is designed so the call to prayer, issued from mosques five times a day, can be heard loud and clear throughout a town or city. Alternatively, the call may be made from the roof or entrance, and is now often projected with the aid of microphones and speakers. The minaret is also a visual symbol of the presence of Islam. (See the six minarets of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, fig. 6.).
        Most mosque courtyards (sahn) contain a public fountain, where believers can perform ablutions, the ritual washing of the hands, feet, and face required before prayer. In the arid lands of Arabia, water is revered as a gift from God, and fountains also have symbolic meaning, alluding to the four rivers of Paradise mentioned in the Qur'an.</li>
</ul>

<h3  style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: steelblue;">The Role of the Mosque</h3>
<p style="font-size: 19px; font-family: serif; font-style: normal;">Mosques reflect the size and needs of individual Muslim communities, as their members all worship together on Fridays. Historically mosques have been at the center of education and intellectual life.

    Inscriptions from the Qur'an adorn the interiors and exteriors of mosques, establishing a strong link between scripture and the place of prayer. 
    Mosque decoration almost never includes human or animal forms, which are seen as potentially idolatrous. 
    Instead, geometric, floral, vegetal, and calligraphic designs adorn mosques, symbolically recalling the promise of Paradise.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: steelblue;">Masjid al-Haram</h1><br>

    <p ><img src="D:\Web development\Web HTML CSS Code\image\f.jpg" alt="Mosques" >
        Masjid al-Haram (Arabic: اَلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْحَرَامُ‎, romanized: al-Masjid al-Ḥarām, lit. 'The Sacred Mosque'),
         also known as the Great Mosque of Mecca, is a mosque that surrounds the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. 
         It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able, and is also the main phase for the ʿUmrah,
          the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. 
          The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa.

        As of August 2020, the Great Mosque is the largest mosque and the eighth largest building in the world. The Great Mosque has undergone major renovations and 
        expansions through the years.[8] It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi 
        Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.</p><br>
        <p>The Great Mosque contends with the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa and Quba Mosque in Medina as the oldest mosque. According to some scholars,
             that reference Islamic tradition and the Quran, explain that the Islamic perspective claims that Islam as a religion preceded Muhammad,representing previous prophets such as Abraham. Abraham is credited by Muslims with having built the Kaaba in Mecca,
              and consequently its sanctuary, which according to the Muslim view is seen as the first mosque[16] that ever existed. According to scholars, Islam started during the lifetime of Muhammad in the 7th century CE,[20] and so did architectural components such as the mosque. 
            In that case, either the Mosque of the Companions or Quba Mosque would be the first mosque that was built in the history of Islam.</p>
